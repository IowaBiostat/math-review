# Analysis

The material in chapters 2 and 3 is intended as review for *incoming* graduate students to prepare them for courses they will take their first year in the program. For students in our PhD program, there is an additional sequence of courses ([BIOS 7110 and BIOS 7250](https://catalog.registrar.uiowa.edu/courses/bios/)) that covers the mathematical foundations of statistics in greater depth. For this material, an understanding of analysis is important.

Analysis is concerned with the same topics as calculus, but calculus focuses on tools from a user perspective ("how do I calculate a derivative?") whereas analysis focuses on theoretical properties (e.g., proving theorems about derivatives and differentiability). So, the table of contents here might appear similar to chapter 2, but the focus is quite different.

NOTE: I am in the process of migrating material here from [this pdf version](http://localhost:8080/pdf/proofs.pdf), so this page is something of a placeholder for now.

REMINDER: If you are an incoming first-year student, you really don't need to worry about this material yet! Just focus on chapters 2 and 3.
