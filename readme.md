# Math review for new biostatistics students

This is a review of math concepts for students beginning a graduate program in biostatistics. The emphasis here is on "prerequisite" concepts -- i.e., mathematical concepts and techniques that your instructor is likely to assume that you already know and won't spend class time reviewing.
