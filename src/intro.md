# Introduction

This guide is intended as a review of fundamental math concepts for students who will be starting an MS or PhD program in biostatistics. More specifically, its intended audience is new students at the University of Iowa, but the material here is quite general and I would expect it to be useful to any new student in a biostatistics program regardless of where it is.

At present, this guide is very much a work in progress -- in places, not much more than an outline. However, our hope is to continue adding to it and making it more useful over the years.

Math: not necessarily the most important thing, but the thing most likely to cause problems in year 1.

Calculus and matrix. Calculus because big. [Matrix](matrix.md) because poorly taught.

Focus on things most relevant. For example, exp not trig.
