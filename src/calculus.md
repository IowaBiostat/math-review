# Calculus

Intro: Why important to statistics? Lots of reasons, but three huge ones:

1. Derivative/optimization/MLE
2. Probability = integral. 
3. Products from independent observations, logs turn that into sums.

Rough outline:

* Functions and maps
* Limits and continuity
* Log and exp
* Derivatives
* Optimization
* Integration
* Kernel trick
* Sequences and series
* Partial derivatives
* Multiple integrals; non-rectangular boundaries
