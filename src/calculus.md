# Calculus

Calculus is important to statistics for lots of reasons, but I would like to point out three major ones before we begin the review.

## Finding most likely solutions

A statistical analysis typically begins with some sort of model for how the data (which I'll call \\(d\\)) depends on an unknown parameter (which I'll call \\(\theta\\)). We observe the data, but what's \\(\theta\\)? To estimate it, we typically create some [function](functions.md) (which I'll call \\(f\\)) that is large when \\(\theta\\) is in agreement with the data we've seen. To find the "best" value of \\(\theta\\), we can take the [derivative](derivatives.md) of \\(f\\) to find the [optimal value](optimization.md). Note that this is actually a [partial derivative](partial.md), since \\(f\\) would be a function of both \\(\theta\\) and \\(d\\).

## Probability and density

## Products

from independent observations, logs turn that into sums.
